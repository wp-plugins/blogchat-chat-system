== Description ==

BLOGCHAT is a live comment and chat system that was created specifically for blogs. With BLOGCHAT, each article or page on your blog can have its own dedicated real time discussion area. BLOGCHAT can be used for both comments and chat; however, it does not replace your existing comment system. It also comes with a whole host of bells and whistles: video conferencing, chat rooms, instant messaging, games, to name a few. BLOGCHAT is a specialized version of the FCChat Chat Platform (See also: FCChat Widget Plugin)

When you upgrade to a new version, any customizations you made to the chat will be erased. In order to save those changes, do the following:

1. Make backup copies of any files that you have altered. You may wish to make backups of the following folders: (fcchat/config, fcchat/languages, fcchat/styles, fcchat/html/config). Place them in a safe place where they will not be deleted. 
1. Next uninstall the old version and install the current version. 
1. Finally, manually copy the changes you made to the old files into the current version's files. Do not replace the new files with the old files, as the structure of the new files may have changed; but instead, use the wordpress file editor to make the changes line by line.

Also, when you upgrade to a new version, it is NOT required that you obtain a new chat ID.
