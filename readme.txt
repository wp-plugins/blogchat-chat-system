When you install the BLOGCHAT Widget, you will only be installing the chat client on your site. Your chat server (meaning your chat data) will be hosted at www.fastcatsoftware.com, on our servers.



== Installation ==

1. Old-school: upload the `BLOGCHAT` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP.  Hipster: Add the BLGOCHAT Widget via the WordPress Plugins menu.
1. Activate the Plugin
1. Visit http://www.fastcatsoftware.com/chat/userguide/blogchat_for_wordpress.asp to finish the installation.

When you upgrade to a new version, any customizations you made to the chat will be erased. In order to save those changes, do the following:

1. Make backup copies of any files that you have altered. You may wish to make backups of the following folders: (fcchat/config, fcchat/languages, fcchat/styles, fcchat/html/config). Place them in a safe place where they will not be deleted. 
1. Next uninstall the old version and install the current version. 
1. Finally, manually copy the changes you made to the old files into the current version's files. Do not replace the new files with the old files, as the structure of the new files may have changed; but instead, use the wordpress file editor to make the changes line by line.

Also, when you upgrade to a new version, it is NOT required that you obtain a new chat ID.
